     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the toolkit from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and follow the instructions.
   - Install the [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

3. **macOS**: 
   - **CUDA support** is unavailable for macOS, but you can still run CPU-based optimizations and models that do not rely on GPU.

### **Installation Steps** üöÄ

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tlama-core.git
   cd tlama-core

### **Run Tlama 124M Model üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

We have a small 124M model available for quick testing. Here‚Äôs how to run it:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("eigencore/tlama-124M", trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("eigencore/tlama-124M", trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "Once upon a time in a distant kingdom..."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
